        <h1>The history behind Heroes' Square</h1>
        <p>Construction began in 1896 to commemorate the thousandth anniversary of the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian
          Basin and the foundation of the Hungarian state in 896, and was part of a much larger construction project which also included the expansion and refurbishing of Andr√°ssy Avenue</p>
        <p>Construction was mostly completed in 1900, which was when the square received its name. The four allegoric sculptures were added in 1906, the monument as a whole basically looked like
           it does today (except for the kings' statues), complete with the surrounding museums on either side, and it was inaugurated still in the same year, 1906.</p>
        <p>When the monument was originally constructed, Hungary was a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and thus the last five spaces for statues on the
           left of the colonnade were reserved for members of the ruling Habsburg dynasty.</p>
        <p>At the front of the monument is the Memorial Stone of Heroes, a large stone cenotaph surrounded by an ornamental iron chain</p>
